# Pod-Race
In browser dolphin racing game.
<<<<<<< HEAD
See who's the fastest dolphin in the pod!

Players start in the top left corner of the screen, and the first dolphin to get to the bottom right corner wins.

Player 1 uses the a, s, d, w keys to move left, down, right and up.

Player 2 uses the j, k, l, i keys to  left, down, right and up.

Player 1 is in the top half of the lane, and Player 2 is in the bottom.

An alert will pop up telling you which player is the winner, and resetting the game.



The game works by moving the player avatars through a series of id'd div elements.  As the player moves forward or backward through the course a variable keeps track of their positive or negative progress.  Movement is simulated by emptying the player avatar from the current div and appending it to the corresponding next div depending on which directional button the player presses.
